# hello-world
The first github repository. 

Hi everyone!
I am a Mechanical Engineer with the focus in human-robot collaboration. My research goal is to enabling more integrated human-robot collaboration, fostering mutual understanding and improving productivity. The approach I take is to study various features of human mind. The insights gained there are always the best guide in designing robots of the next generation.
